 * A dialog with scrollable content: when the content is taller than the panel,
 * `DialogContent` scrolls on its own (`overflow-y-auto`) while the title and actions stay
 * pinned above and below. The demo caps the panel height with `max-h-[70vh]` (the
 * `className` lands on the panel) so the long terms overflow and scroll on any screen,
 * keeping the title and actions in view instead of pushing them off screen.
